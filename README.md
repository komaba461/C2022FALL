# NJNU C Language Programming Course (Fall 2022)

## Course Description
**Course aim** is: training students to grasp the method of structured programming and modular program design method, can use C language to analysis problem, design function, programming. Students should know: 
1. Basic concepts of programming: data types, statement, function, storage structure, etc; 
2. Structured programming method; 
3. Modular program design method; 
4. Classic algorithms based on linear structure.

C is process-oriented programming language which has profound influence, is also the main way of learning to the object-oriented programming. The main contents are as follows: 
1. Sequence structure program based on the I/O and operation of numerical variables. 
2. Branch, loop structure of program based on the numerical variables. 
3. Structured programming based on one/two dimensional array. 
4. Modular program design based on numerical variables. 
5. Modularized program design based on array. 
6. Programming based on custom types. 
7. Programming based on pointer and link list.

This course (Course Code: 100809192204) is suitable for undergraduate students who major in CS. No prior knowledge of C progamming is assumed.
